# Project Gutenberg Analysis
I am analyzing Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's *The Hound of the Baskervilles*.

## Project Structure
The code is located in the `src` directory. The relevant files are...  
- `Gutenberg`, a class that processes the text (located in the `files` directory) and has all the required methods,  
- `MarkovChain`, a class used to generate a sentence, and  
- `GutenbergAnalysis`, which only contains a `main` method.  

A test file (`GutenbergTest`) is located in the `test` directory.

The text for the book is located in the `files` directory, under the name `hound.txt`.
